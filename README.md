# ProjectAlfi

Alfi is your personal assistant in a way. Alfi has certain sensors and with these sensors Alfi can try and learn about your body and will attempt to relay that information back to you in the most efficient and relevant way possible. Alfi relies on you to communicate with him on his accuracy on how you are feeling so he can begin to better understand you. Once Alfi has enough information he can begin to advise you on diets/exercise/ and even medicine one day. Today he is just a friend who can teach you more about what makes you, you one measurement at a time. In the short term giving you insight into your body and in the long term saving your life.
